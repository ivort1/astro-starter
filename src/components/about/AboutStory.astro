      <p class="text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
        Harding Construction was founded on a simple belief: every homeowner deserves a
        contractor they can trust. Anthony Harding started this business not just as a career,
        but as a mission — to bring honest, quality craftsmanship to families throughout the
        Inland Empire.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
        As a family-run operation, we keep things personal. When you call us, you talk to
        Anthony directly. When we're working in your home, we treat it like our own. No pushy
        sales tactics, no hidden fees, no subcontractors you've never met. Just real people
        doing great work.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
        We specialize in kitchen and bathroom remodels, but our skills extend to full home
        renovations, flooring, electrical, painting, drywall, and much more. If it's in your
        home, chances are we can build it, fix it, or make it beautiful.
